ðŸ“š Bash/C/C++ Notes ðŸ“š
=======================

To effectively work with the Cobaya framework and Cosmolike codes at the developer level, a working knowledge of Python to understand Cobaya and Bash language to comprehend Cocoa's scripts is required. Proficiency in C and C++ is also needed to manipulate Cosmolike and the C++ Cobaya-Cosmolike C++ interface. Finally, users need to understand the Fortran-2003 language to modify CAMB.

Learning all these languages can be overwhelming, so to enable new users to do research that demands modifications on the inner workings of these codes, we include `here <https://github.com/CosmoLike/cocoa/blob/main/cocoa_installation_libraries/LectNotes.pdf>`_ a link to approximately 600 slides that provide an overview of Bash (slides 1-137), C (slides 138-371), and C++ (slides 372-599). In the future, we aim to add lectures about Python and Fortran.
