We do not want to discourage people from cloning code from their original repositories. We've included these codes as compressed `xz file format <https://tukaani.org/xz/format.html>`_ in our repository for convenience in the initial development (speed in setting up Cocoa). The work of those authors is extraordinary, and they must be properly cited.
