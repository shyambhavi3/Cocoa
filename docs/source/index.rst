Overview of the Cobaya-CosmoLike Joint Architecture (Cocoa)
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

**Cocoa** allows users to run `CosmoLike <https://github.com/CosmoLike/>`_ routines inside the `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/>`_ framework. 
`CosmoLike <https://github.com/CosmoLike/>`_ can analyze data primarily from the `Dark Energy Survey <https://www.darkenergysurvey.org>`_ and simulate 
future multi-probe analyses for LSST and Roman Space Telescope. Besides 
integrating `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/>`_ and `CosmoLike <https://github.com/CosmoLike/>`_, Cocoa introduces shell scripts and readme 
instructions that allow users to containerize `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/>`_. The container structure ensures that users will adopt the same compiler and libraries (including their versions), and that they will be able to use multiple `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/>`_ instances consistently. 
This readme file presents basic and advanced instructions for installing all `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/>`_ 
and `CosmoLike <https://github.com/CosmoLike/>`_ components.
